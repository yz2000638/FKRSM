The sample generation zone segmentation in this study was conducted using Python, distinguishing between non-water wetlands (for threshold determination) and water-associated wetlands (to separate linear and areal waterbodies). The sample zone generation was implemented in Google Earth Engine (GEE), and the corresponding GEE code is provided in the data link at the end of the article.
